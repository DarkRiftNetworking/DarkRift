    ///     
    ///     For example, imagine we have 3 properties class, level, and highscore and we would 
    ///     like level to be the largest influence on ranking and prefer entities with different 
    ///     classes to be matched together. We can use a MinimiseDifference on both level and 
    ///     highscore to prefer entities with similar values and a NotEqual on our class type. 
    ///     To ensure level has the largest influence we might split our weighting values to 
    ///     0.25, 0.5, 0.25 respectively.
    ///     
    ///     It is important that the weighting of all comparisons totals 1. Without this the
