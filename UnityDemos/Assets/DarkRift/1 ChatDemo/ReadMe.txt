The ChatDemo demonstrates a simple chat application.

To run, start a DarkRift server on your local machine and type:
	demo
to instruct the DarkRift server to act passively and simply forward on all messages to all clients.

If you haven't already done so, set RunInBackground to true in your Unity project settings.

You can now build the ChatDemo scene and run a few copies locally. You should see messages appear on all instances.
