Hello!

Thanks for choosing DarkRift Networking!

In this package you should find 3 examples, the DarkRift libraries for Unity and the DarkRift server (zipped) 
for .NET Framework 4.0. If you have the pro version then you'll also have a DarkRift source archive and builds for .NET Core!

If you're new to DarkRift you should head straight to the Agar tutorial in the documentation (see below!) and 
you might want to have a browse of the included examples. Each example has a ReadMe telling you how to set it 
and the server up so make sure you follow them closely or you it might not work!

Here's some useful links

You can find documentation on the website here:
http://darkriftnetworking.com/DarkRift2/Docs/

There's also a community run discord open to everyone here:
https://discordapp.com/invite/cz2FQ6k

And of course a Unity Forum thread where you can get help:
https://forum.unity.com/threads/darkrift-networking-2.516271/

You can also find plenty extra links, guides and more on the community wiki:

Have fun, and good luck with your game!
