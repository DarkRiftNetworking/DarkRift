The DragDemo shows basic synchronization between clients.

To run, start a DarkRift server on your local machine and type:
	demo
to instruct the DarkRift server to act passively and simply forward on all messages to all clients.

If you haven't already done so, set RunInBackground to true in your Unity project settings.

You can now build the DragDemo scene and run a few copies locally. You should see the icons move as you drag one 
on another client.
